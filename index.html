            Welcome to my final project for INFOTC 1000. My name is <href="aboutme.html">Sergio Pico</a> and I am using this as a portfolio of 
            some 
            experience I have gained throughout my years doing IT. I have worked on computers and electronics since 
            I was a young kid. I was that kid all family members would come to for help with their phones, computers, 
            tv, xbox, pretty much everything. This is demonstrated now in my experience in the IT field. I am actually 
            now majoring in Information Technology. I have gotten to do some pretty awesome things like coding jokes 
            for my friends.
