            Welcome to my final project for INFOTC 1000. My name is <a href="aboutme.html">Sergio Pico</a> and I am using this as a portfolio of 
            some 
            experience I have gained throughout my years doing IT. I have worked on computers and electronics since 
            I was a young kid. I was that kid all family members would come to for help with their phones, computers, 
            tv, xbox, pretty much everything. This is demonstrated now in my <a href="experience.html">experience</a> in the IT field. I am actually 
            now majoring in Information Technology. I have gotten to do some pretty awesome things like 
            <a href="pythonexperience.html">coding jokes<a/> 
            for my friends.

                Once finished seeing all pages click <a href="end.html">here.</a>
